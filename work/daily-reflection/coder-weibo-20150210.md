优秀是一种习惯

## right & wrong
* **right**
  1. made progress on today's core target
  2. turn what you're thinking into what you want
  
* **wrong**
  1. done too little(why so often recently?)
  2. unwillingly to talk about your feelings and thinkings in sprint meeting(pain in the ass)
  
## take away
thinking and doing go together
things can be changed, if you push them forward

## then what?
* more efficient(really important, this gives you more time, more time means more possibilities)
* what can you do when you're tired?
* more organized in work
* more detailed and more organized and more patient
* just open up...
