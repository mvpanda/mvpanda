# who am i
just write it down
just let me know
just let me feel

## spark
* Money!!! 

```
I feel so strong that I need tons of money! 
Not because I'm lazy(but greedy? Who not?)... 
It's just that money really can buy you time, can set you free, can solve most problems.
It's me being lack of patience, I don't feel like waiting too long... 
Turning into 26 years old makes me feel that I don't have much time and not so many opportunities that can be wasted.

|take care of your finances
|positive cash flow

* Time!!!

```
time time time, why are you walking so fast...?
sleep, clean, eat, on way, work, rest, exercise, my girl...

|less is more
|efficiency
|manage it
|use it
```
